## Computer Vision RPS

The image/video trained model identifies the gestures for the game rock , paper and scissiors.
The model uses the Tensorflow deep learning framework and Keras API.
*TensorFlow serves as a powerful and flexible framework for deep learning and machine learning, 
while Keras provides a user-friendly interface and abstraction layer on top of TensorFlow, 
making it easier to build and train neural networks. *
